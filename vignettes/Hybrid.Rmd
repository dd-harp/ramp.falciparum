## Introduction 

In the following, we review hybrid models for the MoI, make a brief observation about prevalence, and then derive hybrid variables for the mean and higher order moments for the AoI. 

## MoI 

The random variable $M$ describes the distribution of the MoI in a population, which follows a Poisson. Here, we provide a numerical demonstration that this novel computational approach is equivalent to the queuing model $M/M/\infty$, and that it is also equivalent to hybrid models for the multiplicity of infection (Nåsell, I. 1985)^[Nåsell, I. (1985). Transmission Models for Malaria. In: Hybrid Models of Tropical Infections. Lecture Notes in Biomathematics, vol 59. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-01609-1_3]:

### $M/M/\infty$

Elsewhere, the dynamics of MoI have be described using the queuing model $M/M/\infty$. The MoI increases with the FoI, and each parasite can clear at some rate, $r$. The following is a diagram for the changes in the fraction of the population with MoI $=i$, denoted $\zeta_i$, change in a host cohort with the force of infection $h_\tau(a),$ and with clearance.

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
\zeta_0 &  {h\atop \longrightarrow} \atop {\longleftarrow \atop r} & \zeta_1 
& {h\atop \longrightarrow} \atop {\longleftarrow \atop {2r}} & \zeta_2 
& {h \atop \longrightarrow} \atop {\longleftarrow \atop {3r}} & \zeta_3 
& {h \atop \longrightarrow} \atop {\longleftarrow \atop {4r}}& \ldots
\end{array}
\end{equation}

***

The master equations for $M/M/\infty$ are:  
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rl}
\frac{d\zeta_0}{da} &= -h_\tau(a) \zeta_0 + r \zeta_1   \\ 
\frac{d\zeta_i}{da} &= -\left( h_\tau\left(a\right) + r i \right) \zeta_i + h_\tau\left(a\right) \zeta_{i-1} + r\left(i+1\right) \zeta_{i+1}   \\ 
\end{array}
\end{equation}

While the master equations describe an infinite set of equations, to find numerical solutions, we must solve a finite set of equations. We need to compute a maximum MoI that has a vanishingly small portion of the distribution. For a constant $h$, the steady state distribution of $\zeta$ is Poisson with mean $h/r.$  If we set $N = \max(4h/r,24),$ the tail is negligible. Here, we set the range to $1 \pm 10^{-7}$ and plot the portion of the distribution covered.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
m = seq(0.1, 24)
N = pmax(24, 4*m)
plot(m, ppois(N,m), type = "l", ylim = c(1-1e-07,1+1e-07))
```

We must define a trace FoI function.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, echo=F}
foiP3 = list(hbar = 5/365, 
             agePar = par_type2Age(), 
             seasonPar = par_sinSeason(), 
             trendPar = par_flatTrend())

a2years  = 0:730

plot(a2years, FoI(a2years, foiP3), type = "l", 
     xlab = "a - age (in days)", ylab = expression(FoI[tau](a)))
```

To verify it works, we compute the MoI each day for the first three years of life. 

```{r}
solveMMinfty(3/365, foiP3) -> out
```

We peek at the distribution of MoI = $1, \ldots, 5$ on day 500: 

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, echo=F}
MoIDistPlot(out$moi, 500)
```

### Nåsell's Hybrid Model

We can also solve the hybrid equation to get the mean MoI (Nåsell, I. 1985)$^1$:

$$\frac{dm}{da} = h - rm$$ 

The unction `dmda` computes the derivative, and we can solve the hybrid equation using `solve_dm` and plot the output: 

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
solve_dm(3/365, foiP3) -> mt 
plot(mt$time, mt$m, type = "l", 
     xlab = "Age (in Days)", ylab = expression(m[tau](a)))
```

### Numerical Verification

We have presented three ways of computing the mean MoI using in a cohort as it ages for an arbitrary function $h_\tau(a)$: 

1. Using `meanMoI` which integrates `zda`: 

$$\int_0^a z_\tau(\alpha, a) d\alpha$$

2. By solving the queuing model $M/M/\infty$, a compartmental model that tracks the full distribution of the MoI, and then competing the mean:

3. By solving a hybrid model tracking the mean MoI.  

```{r compute 3 ways}
aa = 0:1825
v1 = meanMoI(aa, foiP3, hhat=5/365)
v2 = solveMMinfty(5/365, foiP3, Amax=1825)$m
v3 = solve_dm(5/365, foiP3, Amax=1825)[,2]
```


The following plots all three on the same graph using different colors with different widths, colors, and patterns: 

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=8}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(aa, v1, type = "l", col = "red", lwd=4, 
     xlab = "Age (in Days)", 
     ylab = expression(m[tau](a)), 
     main = "meanMoI")

plot(aa, v2, type = "l", lwd=2, 
     xlab = "Age (in Days)", 
     ylab = expression(m[tau](a)), 
     main = "solveMMinfty")
lines(aa, v2, type = "l", col = "yellow", lwd=2, lty=2)

plot(aa, v3, type = "l", col = "darkblue", lwd=1, 
     xlab = "Age (in Days)", 
     ylab = expression(m[tau](a)), 
     main = "solve_dm")

plot(aa, v1, type = "l", col = "red", lwd=4, 
     xlab = "Age (in Days)", 
     ylab = expression(m[tau](a)), 
     main = "All Three")
lines(aa, v2, type = "l", col = "yellow", lwd = 2)
lines(aa, v3, type = "l", col = "darkblue", lwd = 2, lty =2)
```

the maximum errors are on the order of $1e-07$ 

```{r verify MoI 3, purl=F}
c(max(abs(v1-v2)), max(abs(v2-v3)), max(abs(v1-v3)))
```

We have developed a hybrid model that we can use to compute the mean and higher order moments for the age of infection (AoI). In a related vignette ([AoI](AoI.html)), we define the AoI as a random variable and develop functions to compute its moments. Here, we develop a notation for the moments:

## Prevalence

George Maccdonald published a model of superinfection in 1950^[G Macdonald (1950). The analysis of infection rates in diseases in which superinfection occurs. Trop. Dis. Bull. 47, 907–915.].
In presenting the model, Macdonald was trying to solve a problem: if super-infection was possible, then how long would it take until a person would clear all of the parasites to become uninfected again? 
Macdonald proposed a solution, but there was a problem with the mathematical formulation (An essay by Paul Fine, from 1975, is recommended reading)^[Fine PEM (1975). Superinfection - a problem in formulating a problem. Tropical Diseases Bulletin 75, 475–488]:
the model that Macdonald described didn't match the function he used. 
In a model formulated as part of the Garki project (Dietz K, *et al.*,  1974)^[Dietz K, Molineaux L, Thomas A (1974). A malaria model tested in the African savannah. Bull. Wld. Hlth. Org. 50, 347–357.], 
the model allowed for *superinfection* and proposed a useful approximating model. 
One solution came from taking a hybrid modeling approach (Nåsell I, 1985)^[Nåsell I (1985). Hybrid Models of Tropical Infections, 1st edition. Springer-Verlag. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-01609-1], which we have just discussed.  

Nåsell showed that the distribution of the MoI would converge to a Poisson distribution: 

$$M(t) \sim f_M(\zeta; m) = \mbox{Pois}(m(t))$$

Since $m$ is the mean of a Poisson, the prevalence of infection is the complement of the zero term:

$$p(t) = 1-\mbox{Pois}(\zeta =0; m(t)) = 1 - e^{-m(t)}$$

It is, nevertheless, sometimes useful to know the clearance rate, a transition from MoI = 1 to MoI=0. Clearance from the infected class can only occur if a person is infected with an MoI of one, and if that infection clears:  

$$
R(m) = r \frac{\mbox{Pr}(\zeta=1; m(t))}{\mbox{Pr}(\zeta>0; m(t))} = r \frac{m}{e^m - 1} 
$$

The change in prevalence is thus described by the equation: 

$$
\frac{dp}{dt} = h(1-p)-R(m)p 
$$

While this is interesting, and while it solves the problem of modeling clearance under superinfection, the equation depends on $m$. Since we can compute $p(t)$ directly from $m(t)$, the equation is redundant.  

Code exists in `ramp.falciparum` to compute prevalence in three ways:

+ Using the function `truePR`

+ Using the hybrid equations `solve_dpda`

+ From the hybrid model `solve_dm` and $p(t)= 1 - exp(-m(t))$

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, echo=F}
foiP3 = list(hbar=1, agePar = par_type2Age(), seasonPar = par_sinSeason(), trendPar = par_flatTrend()) 
tm = 0:1825
Xt= solve_dpda(5/365, foiP3, Amax=5*365)
tPR = truePR(tm, foiP3, hhat=5/365)
plot(tm, tPR, type = "l", ylab = expression(p(a)), xlab = "Age (Days)", lwd=5, col = "red")
lines(Xt$time, 1-exp(-Xt$m), col = "white", lwd=2)
lines(Xt$time, Xt$p, col = "blue", lwd=2, lty=2)
```

## AoI - Hybrid Variables

Let $x = \left< A\right>;$ x is the first moment of the AoI in a cohort at age $a$, conditioned on a history of exposure, given by a function $h$. In longer form: 
$$x_\tau(a; h) = \left< A_\tau(a; h) \right> = \int_0^\infty \alpha \frac{z_\tau(\alpha, a; h_\tau(a))} {m_\tau(a;h_\tau(a))}$$
Here, we show that: 

$$
\frac{\textstyle{dx}}{\textstyle{da}} = 1- 
\frac{\textstyle{h}}{\textstyle{m}} x  
$$

Similarly, we let $x_{[n]} = \left< A^n \right>$ denote the higher order moments of the random variable $A$. In longer form: 
$$x_{n}(a, \tau; h) = \int_0^\infty \alpha^n \frac{z_\tau(\alpha, a; h_\tau(a))} {m_\tau(a;h_\tau(a))}$$
We show that higher order moments can be computed recursively:

$$
\frac{\textstyle{dx_{[n]}}}{\textstyle{da}} = nx_{[n-1]} -  
  \frac{\textstyle{h}}{\textstyle{m}} x_{[n]}
$$

In the following, we first demonstrate that the hybrid equations give the same answers as direct computation of the moments. 


### Solving 

The function `solve_dAoI` computes the first three moments of the AoI by default. Here we plot the $n^{th}$ root of the first three moments. 

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
par(mar = c(7, 4, 2, 2))
solve_dAoI(5/365, foiP3) -> mt 
plot(mt$time, mt$xn1, type = "l", xlab = "Age (in Days)", ylab = expression(list(x, sqrt(x[paste("[2]")]), sqrt(x[paste("[3]")], 3))), ylim = range(mt$xn3^(1/3))) 
lines(mt$time, mt$xn2^(1/2), col = "purple")
lines(mt$time, mt$xn3^(1/3), col = "darkgreen") 
```

### Numerical Verification 

```{r}
aa = seq(5, 5*365, by = 5) 
moment1 = momentAoI(aa, foiP3)
moment2 = momentAoI(aa, foiP3, n=2)
moment3 = momentAoI(aa, foiP3, n=3)
```

2. By solving a hybrid model with variables that track the moments, using the equations that we derived above: 

```{r} 
solve_dAoI(5/365, foiP3, Amax = 5*365, dt=5) -> mt 
```

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=7}
par(mfrow = c(2,2), mar = c(7, 4, 2, 2))
# Top Left
plot(mt$time, mt$xn1, type = "l", xlab = "Age (in Days)", ylab = expression(x), lwd=3) 
lines(aa, moment1, col = "yellow", lwd=2, lty=2) 
# Top Right 
plot(mt$time, mt$xn2, type = "l", xlab = "Age (in Days)", ylab = expression(x[paste("[2]")]), lwd=3, col = "purple") 
lines(aa, moment2, col = "yellow", lwd=2, lty=2)
plot(mt$time, mt$xn3, type = "l", lwd=3, col = "darkgreen",
     xlab = "Age (in Days)", ylab = expression(x[paste("[3]")]))
lines(aa, moment3, col = "yellow", lwd=2, lty=2)
par(mar = c(7, 4, 2, 2))
solve_dAoI(5/365, foiP3) -> mt 
plot(mt$time, mt$xn1, type = "l", xlab = "Age (in Days)", ylab = expression(list(x, sqrt(x[paste("[2]")]), sqrt(x[paste("[3]")], 3))), lwd=3, ylim = range(mt$xn3^(1/3))) 
lines(mt$time, mt$xn2^(1/2), col = "purple", lwd=3)
lines(mt$time, mt$xn3^(1/3), col = "darkgreen", lwd=3) 
lines(aa, moment1, col = "yellow", lwd=2, lty=2)
lines(aa, moment2^(1/2), col = "yellow", lwd=2, lty=2)
lines(aa, moment3^(1/3), col = "yellow", lwd=2, lty=2)
```

## AoY - Hybrid Variables

Let $y$ denote the first moment of the AoY.

$$
y_\tau(a) = \int_0^a \alpha \; f_Y(\alpha, a, \tau) \; d\alpha 
$$ 

A differential equation for $y_\tau(a)$ is:

$$
\frac{dy}{da} = 1 - \frac{h}{p} y + \phi(r,m) x 
$$

Where $\phi$ computes the probability that an infection with MoI$\geq 2$ *increases* with a loss. 

To verify, we can compute the moment directly. The function `solve_dAoYda` gives solutions: 

```{r}
solve_dAoYda(5/365, foiP3, Amax=5*365, dt=5, n=9) -> mt
```

The moments can be computed directly using `momentAoY`

```{r}
moment1y = momentAoY(aa, foiP3, hhat=5/365)
```



The following plots the first moment computed both ways:

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, echo=F}
plot(aa, moment1y, type = "l", lwd=2, xlab = "Age (in Days)")
with(mt, lines(time, y, col = "darkred", lwd=2))
```


```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, echo=F, eval=F}
plot(moment1y-mt$y[-1], type = "l", xlab = "Age (in Days)", ylab = "Errors")
```
